This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Crypto Slang

The official(wannabe) resource for slangs used when dealing with cryptos1

## Submit a new slang:
Just submit the slang on [google form](https://forms.gle/hjYEWGzacgLwhXcK8) and i will add it post review.


## Development
I have made this website in a lot of hurry so apologize for the poor code quality.
Code Base:
- Next.js
- Database: I did not want to set up an entire cloud database so have made a json object where i will keep adding more slangs as i keep receiving them.

### ToDo:
- [ ] Improve SEO!!
- [ ] Custom Animation.
- [ ] Micro Interactions.
- [ ] Persistent Dark/Light Mode with Reload.
- [ ] A Custom and better Modal for displaying slang info.


## Why?
Had some free time and this though like a great fun project to develop on the side! i wish to make more such website on and around crypto as and when i get time, which will help me not only stay updated on the tech side but also, it is, in its own way my little contribution to the community.
